    "# Evaluate pseudotime goodness-of-fit by scDesign3\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we will show how to use scDesign3 to evaluate the pseudotime goodness-of-fit for different pseudotime labels. If the true labels are unavailable and we have little prior knowledge, the scDesign3 BIC can serve as an unsupervised metric. In this tutorial, we will first use the R package `dyngen` to generate a dataset with ground truth \"pseudotime\". Then, we will perturb the ground truth pseudotime to worsen its quality and use scDesign3’s BIC to examine pseudotime goodness-of-fit.\n",
